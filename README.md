# angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-directive

Updated A wrapper directive around the [bootstrap-datetimepicker component](http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/).

## How to Use

1- Install the directive via bower (or download it manually, as you prefer)

	bower install angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-directive --save

2- Load all required scripts by `eonasdan-bootstrap-datetimepicker`.
Refer to the [official guide](http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/Installing/).

3- Include the `angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-directive.js` into your HTML.
A minified variant is provided for production named `angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-directive.min.js`.

4- Inject the `datetimepicker` directive in you angular app:

	angular
	  .module('myApp', [
	    // Other injected modules.

	    'datetimepicker'
	  ]);

5- You can start using the directive in your HTML in several ways like:

a) Passing in a JSON object with the options
```html
	<input type="text" class="form-control input-sm"

	       datetimepicker
	       datetimepicker-options="{icons:{next:'glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right',previous:'glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left',up:'glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up',down:'glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down'}}"

	       placeholder="..."
	       name="time"
	       ng-model="ctrl.time">
```
b) Passing in an angular scoped variable that holds the options

```html
	<input type="text" class="form-control input-sm"

	       datetimepicker
	       datetimepicker-options="{{ ctrl.datetimepicker_options }}"

	       placeholder="..."
	       name="time"
	       ng-model="ctrl.time">
```
c) Set the default options with the provider and use the datepicker with those
default options.

```html
	<input type="text" class="form-control input-sm"

	       datetimepicker

	       placeholder="..."
	       name="time"
	       ng-model="ctrl.time">

	<script type="text/javascript">
		'use strict';

		angular
				.module('app', [
					'datetimepicker'
				])
				.config([
					'datetimepickerProvider',
					function (datetimepickerProvider) {
						datetimepickerProvider.setOptions({
							locale: 'en'
						});
					}
				]);
	</script>
```

All options are named identically with the same letter case.

## Supported `eonasdan-bootstrap-datetimepicker` options

All of them :) If you find anyone that is causing havoc file an issue. Please,
first test that is the directive and not the original jQuery plugin which is
causing it.

## Setting default values for all datetimepickers

Use the `datetimepickerProvider` to set them

	<script type="text/javascript">
		'use strict';

		angular
				.module('app', [
					'datetimepicker'
				])
				.config([
					'datetimepickerProvider',
					function (datetimepickerProvider) {
						datetimepickerProvider.setOptions({
							locale: 'en'
						});
					}
				]);
	</script>

Those default options will be overwritten by the provided in the inline definition.

## Why passing an unified JSON and not option by option?

Just one word: **simplicity**.

The option by option variant have a lot of related issues, one of them is that
the directive has to know every single option of the original plugin, how to parse
it, how to include it into the directive with the isolated scope and so on.
Besides, this limit future options since have to be added too.

There are a lot more but that isn't the goal of this README after all, so I won't
do a full enumeration of them.
